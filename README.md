# RISC-V CPU

A Verilog program that mimics a RISC-V CPU by taking a set of instructions and performing them.

LabN5.v is used to test cpu.v and displays the RISC-V program.



DISCLAIMER:
RISC-V instruction is saved as ram.dat.
'hrLib' folder was not created by me, it was provided by university instructors.
